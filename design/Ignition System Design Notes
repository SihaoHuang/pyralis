Nitrous Oxide General Information
-Decomposes at extremely high temperatures; non-deflagrating
-->Purely thermal ignition systems have been shown to be ineffective
---->Investigated possibility of using oxygen to lower ignition energy; the authors of "Flammability, Ignition Energy and Flame Speed" attempted this method and found that the ignition energy of a mixture of nitrous oxide and methane was insensitive to additional oxygen.
----->Hypergolic options exist. They are unpleasant and best if avoided. They also require a large amount of additional weight (pressure tanks, plumbing, control...) and would likely preclude restart capability without more, heavier, and more complex plumbing.
------>Spark ignition is the preferred method.

Nitrous Oxide Ignition
-The authors of "Flammability, Ignition Energy and Flame Speed" found that the flammability limits of the nitrous oxide-methane mixture at STP were unaffected by increasing the ignition energy beyond 1J.
-->Order-of-magnitude similarity assumption => the necessary ignition energy of the nitrous oxide-ethane mixture should be fairly constant beyond 10J.

If an ignition energy of 10J is not available, it may be possible to achieve a similar effect by applying a very high voltage at a low current as well as a lower voltage at a high current, with the goal of decomposing some of the reactants electrically in addition to supplying a reasonable ignition energy.
Relevance: Camera flash (potential ignition method) provides an ignition energy of 6.1J via a capacitor with C = 120microFarad, V = 320v. More likely, it will prove effective to use two or more of these or similar capacitors in parallel as a separate capacitor bank module. This would increase charging times (currently ~4sec, soon to be timed more precisely) but, if the ignition energy were pushed high enough, would likely make the issue of local mixture ratio irrelevant by supplying sufficient energy to a larger volume of gas.



Prospective Spark Ignition Methods

1: Inductive - Flyback Transformer
PROS
-High frequency spark --> more likely to coincide in time with a local propellant mixture ratio conducive to ignition --> fewer delays
-Immediate response to control input --> fewer delays
-Easily adjustable voltage (wind/unwind coils, change input voltage)
CONS
-Potentially heavy, as inductors generally are.
-Slow application of energy; no convenient measure for calculating equivalent ignition energy.

2: Capacitive - Voltage-pump Charged Capacitor Bank
PROS
-Easily measurable ignition energy.
-Easily adjustable voltage and energy.
-Lighter than a flyback - entire system could easily stay < 100g.
-Large ignition energy may render the issue of local mixture ratio irrelevent by supplying adequate ignition energy to a large volume of gas (and therefore a large sample of mixture ratios) --> fewer delays
CONS
-Long charge time --> less likely to coincide in time with a local propellant mixture ratio conducive to ignition --> more delay
-Need more control equipment; probably need a physical switch to connect the capacitor bank to the spark plug at the appropriate moment. 

3: Combinations - Flyback or voltage pump to initiate arc across spark gap, decreasing resistance enough to allow a lower-voltage capacitor to discharge.
PROS
???
CONS
Weird idea, may not be a workable concept

4. Capacitive Type II - Voltage Pump
PROS
-All the pros of the Flyback Transformer
-Extremely light (ordered a <100g solution)
CONS
-Same as Flyback transformer, except the weight
