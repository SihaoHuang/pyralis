***This paper contains useful values for the ignition energy of nitrous-methane mixtures, which we can expect to be similar (at least within an order of magnitude) to the values for nitrous-ethane mixtures. -James Logan***

Key design points, issues, and related values:

Enthalpy of formation of nitrous oxide N2O: 82.5 kJ/mol
Enthalpy of formation of ethane C2H6: -83.7 kJ/mol

Explosive mixture range of ethane in air (given as percent ethane by volume): 3%-12.4%

Nitrous Oxide General Information
-Decomposes at extremely high temperatures; non-deflagrating
-->Purely thermal ignition systems have been shown to be ineffective
---->Investigated possibility of using oxygen to lower ignition energy; the authors of "Flammability, Ignition Energy and Flame Speed" attempted this method and found that the ignition energy of a mixture of nitrous oxide and methane was insensitive to additional oxygen.
----->Hypergolic options exist. They are unpleasant and best if avoided. They also require a large amount of additional weight (pressure tanks, plumbing, control...) and would likely preclude restart capability without more, heavier, and more complex plumbing.
------>Spark ignition is the preferred method.

Nitrous Oxide Ignition
-The authors of "Flammability, Ignition Energy and Flame Speed" found that the flammability limits of the nitrous oxide-methane mixture at STP were unaffected by increasing the ignition energy beyond 1J.
-->Order-of-magnitude similarity assumption => the necessary ignition energy of the nitrous oxide-ethane mixture should be fairly constant beyond 10J.

If an ignition energy of 10J is not available, it may be possible to achieve a similar effect by applying a very high voltage at a low current as well as a lower voltage at a high current, with the goal of decomposing some of the reactants electrically in addition to supplying a reasonable ignition energy.
Relevance: Camera flash (potential ignition method) provides an ignition energy of 6.1J via a capacitor with C = 120microFarad, V = 320v
